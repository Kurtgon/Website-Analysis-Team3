*Website Analysis: https://www.info-computer.com/*

**What site is this? (Is it clear enough?)**


        
        It is an online computer store of new, second hand or reconditioned products. 
        
        It's clear enough but not only sells computers, also cell phones, servers,  printers, headsets, etc ... 

        They also offer various services including equipment repair.

**Does it follow conventions?**

- Desktop version:

        Follow the standard conventions, its logo leads to the home page and the menus and navigation bars are where they should be.

        The menu, the search bar and the icons are distributed on regular sites and are easy to find and distinguish.
        
        Any site on the web maintains the same header.

- To be improved:

        Some Drop-down section opens some subcategories and others do not.

        The name of the site is not associated with an online store, because of the info theme (usual information, forums or wiki).

        The header menu does not remain fixed when scrolling.

        The navigation sub-menu presents tabs with a lot of information.


        The product slider is clear and in accordance with the image of the site, but the navigation arrows are not operative and are visible, confusing the user.


- Mobile version:


        It follows the standard conventions and complies with the responsive regulations.

- To be improved:


        The hamburger menu should show the active page.

        
**Is the hierarchy evident (sections, subsections,â€¦)? Can I see the major sections of the site? What options do I have at this level of the hierarchy?**

- Both versions:

        Well organized hierarchies and as in the previous section the header is visible from any site of the website that also includes the sections. 


**Are the pages divided in well defined sections / layers?**

    Yes, they are divided and perfectly identifiable. 
    
    The main sections/categories of the page are visible from any section or category.

- To be improved:

        The Paypal button does not appear in its entirety during the purchase process.


**Can you distinguish links and buttons?**

    The links are not clear or are not reinforced with a button.


**Is there any content that distracts the user?**

- Both versions:

        No, there is no external advertising on the website.


**Is the content structured?**

- Both versions:

        Each section is well organized and does not mix sections with each other.


**Are there any search options? Are they clear enough?**

      The searches show you related products, and also include aids such as brand and category.

- To improve:

        Price filtering does not work properly.


**General Conclusion**

- Desktop version:

        In general lines it is functional although it has some elements to improve

- Mobile version:

        It is more optimized and more intuitive than the desktop version.
